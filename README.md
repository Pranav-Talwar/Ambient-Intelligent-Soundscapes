# Ambient-Intelligent-Soundscapes
A consent-first ambient intelligence system that augments shared study spaces with hybrid personality assisted learning driven soundscapes, using opt-in intent NFC taps, occupancy, ambient noise, and multi-speaker layouts to balance room level and personal audio so people can focus or unwind together without disappearing into headphones.
